# Quantum-Superposition-Demo
This project demonstrates a basic quantum circuit using Qiskit, showing how a single qubit can be placed into superposition using the Hadamard gate (H). The circuit is executed on a simulator, and the measurement distribution is visualised to show the probabilistic nature of quantum states.
